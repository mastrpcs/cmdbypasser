# cmdbypasser
Use this to bypass your 'accidentally' blocked command prompt.
[Latest release here](https://github.com/mastrpcs/cmdbypasser/releases/latest)


## Usage:
launch the batch file, if batch files are also 'accidentally' blocked zip the file by itself and run through the zip 
(it works the same)

## Have fun!
*Any issues feel free to open an issue and have a go at fixing it*
